    <h1>Visual essays</h1>
    <p>The forthcoming series of visual essays is an experiment in analyzing Soviet literary journals through explorations of their data. Accompanied by interpretative essays, data visualizations will address among other things the occurrence of textual genres, development of press runs, and movement of editors between periodicals.</p>

        <h2>Hiring and Firing: Editorial Offices between Rupture and Continuity</h2>
        <div class="essay_teaser">
        <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/visual_essays/hiring_firing.png')}}" alt="A Visualization of Editorial Staff">
        <p>Few editorial offices have been subject to as detailed an analysis as the one of Novyi mir under Aleksandr Tvardovsky in the early 1960s. With the end of his tenure as chief editor in 1970, the journal was restructured significantly, a large group of editorial staff was dismissed and new editors hired.<br>
        While we commonly assume that the replacement of a chief editor was very disruptive to the work of editorial offices, this visual essay traces a different story in the data. In many periodicals, such as Iunostâ€™ or Nash sovremennik, core groups of staff remained. This can explain the continuities in editorial policies and practice, allowing us to reconsider traditional approaches to periodization in Soviet literature.</p>
