The project traces the emergence of segmented artistic and political communities in the 1960s and 1970s in their data, showing how social organization determined aesthetic and literary taste.</p>  
		    		<p>Soviet Journals Reconnected consists of four components: an introduction to the central literary periodicals of the late Soviet era, interactive network visualizations of authors published in the journals, a series of visual essays and a technical documentation of the SJR database.</p>
